# OS Kernel (v150 something)

I made a new kernel :)

### How to use

Open on Replit (Files included), run build.sh (Linux), or convert build.sh to windows :)

### Notes:

This may or may not work with other VMs like VMware or VBox. I have only recently tested the kernel on QEMU and have had some issues with multiboot previously.
